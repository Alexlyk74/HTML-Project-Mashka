    <p>Mashka had an uncanny ability to summon treats with just a purr, and she knew that belly rubs were the key to world domination. Her favourite pastime was to ambush unsuspecting shoelaces, proving that even the mightiest of humans could be brought down by a cunning kitty. When it came to napping, Mashka was an undisputed master. She could sleep through earthquakes, thunderstorms, and even the vacuum cleaner's most valiant efforts. Rumour had it she had a secret nap training academy hidden deep in the cushions of the living room couch.</p>
